# What You Don't Know You Don't Know

## Filling in the gaps post-bootcamp

### This project is the result of asking many developers who either had graduated from a coding bootcamp, or who had worked with someone they knew graduated from a coding bootcamp, about significant gaps in knowledge they noticed among gradtuates. This is a list of the most commented on gaps, as well as links to resources to help graduates continue learning. 

### As much as possible, I have tried to include resources which work for different learning styles, and I welcome PR's to add additional resources. Please feel free to clone, branch, and add to this. I hope it stays current and is updated frequently.
